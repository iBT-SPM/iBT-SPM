# Use a file of this format if one or more of the above items is incorrect in
# image headers. Uncomment lines above that you need to override.
# Some image processing scripts currently in use at BRI look for a
# _header_override.txt file and, if it exists, use it to override certain values
# read directly from the image header. This file should be placed in the
# same subdirectory as the affected original images (e.g. each subdirectory of
# the affected run for functional GE vp-signa workstation images). Please
# ask a person with permission to add to the image archive to do this for you.
# Pre-processing scripts will then automatically copy this to the processed
# data directory. If you are accessing original data from read-only media, then
# you will need to place this file manually in the processed data directory
# for each analysis that you perform on the affected data.
