For a summary of iBT changes, please see ../whats_new.txt

Files in the ChangeLog folder include a detailed history of runinfo template
files, which may be useful for users upgrading from previous versions of iBT.

Note that we aim to achieve backwards compatibility with earlier runinfo files, so old runinfos should still work.
